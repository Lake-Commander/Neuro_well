üîç 1. What challenges did you face while handling missing data? How did you resolve them?
Challenges Faced:

Missing values in critical features such as 'Mental Fatigue Score' and 'Burn Rate', which are numerical and directly tied to the prediction task.

Some categorical fields (e.g., 'WFH Setup Available') had missing or inconsistent entries, which could bias the model if not treated properly.

How It Was Resolved:

For numerical features, we used mean imputation to fill missing values, which preserved the dataset‚Äôs size and reduced information loss.

For categorical features, we applied mode imputation and encoded them appropriately (e.g., using one-hot encoding or label encoding depending on the model).

Additionally, a data audit step was performed to ensure the imputation did not skew distributions significantly.

üöÄ 2. Which machine learning algorithm performed the best, and why do you think it outperformed others?
Best Performer:
The Random Forest Regressor delivered the highest R¬≤ score and lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) among all tested models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, etc.).

Why It Outperformed:

Random Forests handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features very well ‚Äî something simpler linear models struggled with in this context.

It is robust to outliers and overfitting, especially when cross-validated and tuned.

The dataset contained both categorical and numerical features ‚Äî Random Forest inherently supports mixed data types after encoding, which improved generalization.

üìà 3. If you had access to additional data, what would you like to include, and how might it improve your model?
Additional Data Desired:

Workload metrics: Number of weekly tasks, overtime hours, or project deadlines met.

Employee engagement scores: Surveys or performance feedback metrics.

Department/Team information: To detect team-level burnout patterns.

Time-based features: Recent promotions, last leave taken, or tenure patterns.

Expected Improvements:

These would provide a richer behavioral and organizational context, allowing the model to learn more nuanced burnout predictors.

Time-based patterns could capture progressive burnout trends, improving predictive power.

Team or department-level data would support group-level interventions, making the model not only accurate but actionable.
