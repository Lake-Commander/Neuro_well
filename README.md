# 🧠 Employee Burnout Prediction

This project predicts employee burnout levels based on factors such as job designation, company type, resource allocation, mental fatigue and work-from-home setup. It uses machine learning models trained on a real-world dataset and presents predictions through a user-friendly Streamlit app.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on burnout drivers
- 📊 Correlation & Bivariate Visualizations
- 🧠 Machine learning models: Random Forest, Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression
- 📈 Performance metrics: MSE, R² Score
- 🌐 Streamlit App for real-time burnout prediction

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.13
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Streamlit

## 🧪 Train Your Own Model
**To train a new model with your dataset:**

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format. Use the sample datasets here for schema reference.

2. Open and run a3.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

3. Follow the steps to preprocess, train and save the model.

4. Ensure your app loads the new model path.
